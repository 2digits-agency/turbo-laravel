**This package gives you a set of conventions to make the most out of [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/) in Laravel** (inspired by the [turbo-rails](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails) gem). There is a [companion application](https://github.com/tonysm/turbo-demo-app) that shows how to use the package and its conventions in your application.

## Installation

You may install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require tonysm/turbo-laravel
```

You may publish the asset files with:

```bash
php artisan turbo:install
```

You may also use Turbo Laravel with Jetstream if you use the Livewire stack. If you want to do so, you may want to publish the assets using the `--jet` flag:

```bash
php artisan turbo:install --jet
```

The install command will require and publish a couple JS files to your application. By default, it will add `@hotwired/turbo` to your `package.json` file and publish another custom HTML tag to integrate Turbo with Laravel Echo. With the `--jet` flag, it will also add a couple bridges libs needed to make sure you can use Hotwire with Jetstream, these are:

* [Alpine Turbo Bridge](https://github.com/SimoTod/alpine-turbo-drive-adapter), needed so Alpine.js works nicely; and
* [Livewire Turbo Plugin](https://github.com/livewire/turbolinks) needed so Livewire works nicely. This one will be added to your Jetstream layouts (both `app.blade.php` and `guest.blade.php`)

You can optionally also install Stimulus on top of this all by passing `--stimulus` flag to the `turbo:install` command. It's optional because we can either use Alpine.js or Stimulus (or both /shrug):

```bash
php artisan turbo:install --jet --stimulus
```

The package ships with a middleware that applies some conventions on your redirects, specially around how failed validations are redirected automatically by Laravel. To read more about this, check out the [Conventions](#conventions) section documentation. You may add the middleware to the "web" route group on your HTTP Kernel, like so:

```php

namespace App\Http;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Kernel as HttpKernel;

class Kernel extends HttpKernel
{
    protected $middlewareGroups = [
        'web' => [
            // ...
            \Tonysm\TurboLaravel\Http\Middleware\TurboMiddleware::class,
        ],
    ];
}
```

Keep reading the documentation to have a full picture on how you can make the most out of the technique.

### Closing Notes

Try the package out. Use your Browser's DevTools to inspect the responses. You will be able to spot every single Turbo Frame and Turbo Stream happening.

Make something awesome!
